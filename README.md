Smex is short for **S**ite**M**ap **EX**trator. It can handle various operations related to sitemaps with more being 
build over time. Smex has grown from the frustration of migrating multiple websites in the past and handling changes in 
URL semantics and massive amount of assets like images.  

Smex supports: 
- [x] extraction of urls
- [x] process local/remote sitemaps
- [x] output to csv/json
- [x] pattern matching on urls
- [x] extraction of images
- [ ] extraction of video
- [ ] extraction of news
- [ ] url status checking
- [ ] support for sitemaps with multiple languages

Note: smex is not a sitemap validator and would not check the validity of sitemaps against the xsd. It will try to parse
the sitemaps on best effort.

## Usages

### Extract

To extract information from sitemap

The following command extracts only the urls from yoast's post sitemaps and prints to stdout

`smex extract https://yoast.com/post-sitemap.xml --remote --loc`

You can also perform the extraction at a sitemap locally

`smex extract ~/Download/sitemap.xml`

If you want to change the format of the extraction simply use `--format` flag, csv & json are supported

`smex extract https://yoast.com/post-sitemap.xml --remote --format csv`

To filter the URLs you can supply a valid regex pattern using `--pattern` flag

`smex extract https://yoast.com/post-sitemap.xml --remote  --pattern ".*seo.*" --format csv`

The `--output` will change the filename, this is defaulted to `smex-output.(csv|json)`
